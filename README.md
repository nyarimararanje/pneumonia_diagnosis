# Deep-Learning Based Pneumonia Diagnosis using chest x-rays
An AI and ML model that uses images from Kaggle to train a model to recognize pneumonia chest X-rays. 

#Project Motivation
AI is being increasingly integrated into medicine, and this was an opportunity to research more about that and apply my knowledge of ML and AI models.
The project compares CNN and VGG16 by using both of them and creating plots and confusion matrices to compare their effectiveness.

#Installation

```bash
pip install opencv
```
```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
